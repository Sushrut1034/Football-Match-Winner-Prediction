EPL Match Outcome Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the outcomes of English Premier League (EPL) matches using machine learning techniques. It involves web scraping historical match data, processing it, and applying a Random Forest classifier for predictions. Key steps include data collection, feature extraction, model development, and accuracy evaluation.

Project Structure
Part 1: Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup
Objective: Gather comprehensive EPL match data, including match statistics and metadata.

Tools:

Beautiful Soup: Parses HTML content for structured data.
Files:

scrape_epl_data.py: Script to scrape detailed EPL match data from football data sources.
Data Directories:

data/matches/: Stores scraped match data.
Part 2: Data Processing and Feature Engineering
Objective: Clean and prepare raw data for machine learning model input.

Tools:

Pandas: Manipulates and cleans data for modeling.
Statistical Techniques: Utilizes rolling averages and other methods for feature engineering.
Files:

process_epl_data.py: Processes scraped data, cleans outliers, and engineers features.
epl_matches.csv: Processed dataset ready for modeling.
Part 3: Building a Random Forest Classifier Model
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict EPL match outcomes.

Tools:

Scikit-learn: Implements and evaluates the Random Forest classifier model.
Files:

epl_model.py: Trains the Random Forest classifier model, performs feature selection, and evaluates predictions.
epl_matches.csv: Input data used for model training and testing.
Key Steps
Scrape EPL Data: Automate the collection of match data from football data sources for the desired seasons.
Process and Engineer Features: Clean and transform raw data into a structured dataset suitable for analysis.
